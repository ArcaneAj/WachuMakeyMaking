"Raven Coal",28199,"Once the dense coal has been ground into powder and mixed with water, it can be used as a substitute for ink. Be sure to keep it away from white clothing, as the stains are a bugger to get out."
"Amh Araeng Seasonings",28200,"This selection of rare varieties of salt and spices native to Amh Araeng can be used to add a dash of elegance and a pinch of class to even the most unappetizing of dishes."
"Clinquant Stones",28201,"Every region of Norvrandt is, for some reason, blessed with an astonishing variety of glittering, shimmering, sparkling, and otherwise shiny stones. Il Mheg is no exception, as is amply demonstrated by these fine specimens."
"Airship Fitting Components",28202,"In the hands of an artisan, these bits and pieces gathered from around Amh Araeng will eventually become the decorations used to adorn Eulmore's fleet of airships. In fact, it took another sort of artisan to even find them in the first place, having been forced to separate the proverbial wheat from the chaff in some of the desert's most perilous locations."
"Kholusian Miscellany",28203,"While not everything included in this assortment of locally sourced materials could be considered valuable, the various items combine to convey the very essence of Kholusia. This could, however, be attributed to the pungent oceanic odor they all seem to share."
"Flyer Printing Materials",28204,"Perhaps one day, these humble materials will fulfill their dream of being turned into flyers to advertise Eulmore's finest drinking and ogling establishment. With your help, this dream may very well come true."
"Kholusian Cuisine Paraphernalia",28205,"An artisan's touch is required to turn this hodgepodge into something the Beehive's kitchen staff can use to produce its reasonably priced and reasonably tasty fare."
"Honeybee Trappings Materials",28206,"As sparkly and fabulous as these assorted materials may be, they have a long way to go before they can be added to the costume worn by the Beehive's songstress."
"Airship Fitting Materials",28207,"Few could envision that these rather uninspiring objects will eventually be soaring gracefully through the skies. Strictly speaking, it will be the airship to which they are attached that will be doing the flying, but it still counts."
"Beehive Souvenir Materials",28208,"As anyone who has had the dubious pleasure of visiting a seaside tourist trap can attest, the majority of the souvenirs sold are made from cheap and readily available materials, often found washed up on the shore along with the driftwood and dead jellyfish. The contents of this bag are─as is tradition─of similar ilk, clearly indicated by the dried seaweed with which most of the items are covered."

"Kholusian Rain",28722,"A highly concentrated elixir blended on the island of Kholusia."
"Eulmoran Certificate of Import",28723,"A note of promise received for the delivery of facet equipment."
"Crafter's Delineation",28724,"A detailed outline of complex crafting techniques. One delineation is consumed when using a specialist action."
"Skybuilders' Plywood",28725,"Sturdy enough to support the weight of several large Roegadyn. Until it isn't."
"Skybuilders' Alloy",28726,"At this stage, it is anyone's guess what this alloy will become. If it is extremely lucky, it may even end up as a door knocker."
"Skybuilders' Steel Plate",28727,"Unless a skilled blacksmith or armorer can intervene, this steel is doomed to spend eternity as a useless metal square."
"Skybuilders' Ingot",28728,"Even the skybuilders themselves are not quite sure what goes into these ingots, although the general consensus is that it is nothing valuable."
"Skybuilders' Leather",28729,"Leather made for skybuilders, not from them. Apparently."
"Skybuilders' Rope",28730,"How long is a length of rope? In this particular rope's case, this long."
"Skybuilders' Ink",28731,"Used for writing in ledgers to keep track of who is owed what. Considering the scale of the Ishgardian restoration, it is expected that a fair few bottles will be exhausted before the work is completed."
"Skybuilders' Hemp Milk",28732,"By all accounts, this plant-based milk has a pleasant enough taste, though Ishgardian culinarians have yet to succeed in efforts to turn it into cheese."
"Skybuilders' Wain",28733,"Surprisingly maneuverable, even when loaded with bricks and such."
"Skybuilders' Nails",28734,"Thankfully, this is a handful of metal nails, not ones grown from the fingers of the skybuilders themselves. That would be far less pleasant."
"Skybuilders' Rivets",28735,"Those with a penchant for having little bits of metal sticking out from every surface in sight will be delighted to receive these carefully crafted metal studs."
"Skybuilders' Rings",28736,"An object without a clear purpose but will “probably come in handy one day,” as hoarders of useless junk are wont to say."
"Skybuilders' Leather Straps",28737,"Can be attached to the handles of tools to allow them to be hung from belts and so forth, though care should be taken while walking to avoid having them flailing around wildly."
"Skybuilders' Cloth",28738,"It seems this cloth is destined to become part of a comfortable couch, or perhaps a nice set of drapes."
"Skybuilders' Plant Oil",28739,"Used in the preparation of several varieties of Ishgardian cooking and, on some occasions, as a condiment."
"Skybuilders' Uncooked Pasta",28740,"Uncooked pasta that is perfect for eating during construction. If you like uncooked pasta."
"Skybuilders' Barrel",28741,"The expression “a barrel of laughs” was never meant to be taken literally, though if it were, one could fit a fair few in this voluminous wooden container."
"Skybuilders' Hammer",28742,"In days to come, this most versatile of tools will become the bane of every nail that dared to stick out. And the occasional thumb."
"Skybuilders' Cooking Pot",28743,"In times of war, this metallic item of cookware can double as a makeshift helmet, provided the wearer has an unnaturally large head."
"Skybuilders' Candelabra",28744,"It almost seems a shame to cover this in layers of melted wax, though sadder still would be a candelabra without a candle."
"Skybuilders' Rug",28745,"The eventual owner of this majestic piece of thick cloth will be as snug as a bug in a rug. Or on a rug, to be precise."
"Skybuilders' Broom",28746,"As the saying goes, “A new broom sweeps clean,” though the person wielding said broom is also due at least some of the credit for any increase in cleanliness that may result."
"Skybuilders' Charcoal",28747,"The recipients of the other items in your inventory would probably prefer that you refrained from carrying loose pieces of charcoal about your person."
"Skybuilders' Tea",28748,"As is tradition with tea brewed for builders, it contains enough sugar to make the spoon stand on end."
"Skybuilders' Pedestal",28749,"Though one should avoid putting other people on a pedestal, the placement of inanimate objects should not pose any problems."
"Skybuilders' Crosscut Saw",28750,"It is not only double-edged blades that cut both ways."
"Skybuilders' Counter",28751,"Considering that it lacks the ability to count anything whatsoever, “counter” seems to be something of a misnomer."
"Skybuilders' Stone",28752,"If the time you have spent in Ishgard has taught you anything, it is that the locals really like stone."
"Skybuilders' Longboots",28753,"Ideal for leaping from scaffold to scaffold as one merrily frolics about the construction site, while others go about their backbreaking labor."
"Skybuilders' Gloves",28754,"Any Ishgardian with any sense will already own a pair of gloves, but for those who do not, these will be a welcome gift."
"Skybuilders' Soap",28755,"Be careful to whom you give this. They may think you are trying to tell them something."
"Skybuilders' All-purpose Infusion",28756,"Though the recipe states that this mysterious concoction can cure any ailment, one must remember that it will under no circumstances reattach dismembered fingers, which is a remarkably common complaint among the skybuilders."
"Skybuilders' Bed",28757,"Children who fail to heed the word of their parents will be sent here without any supper."
"Skybuilders' Oven",28758,"In many Ishgardian residences, the oven doubles as a means of heating the house, with the occupants finding themselves subconsciously drawn to the kitchen during the colder months. Which is all of them."
"Skybuilders' Lamppost",28759,"Of all the items you have managed to stow about your person, this surely ranks as one of the largest and most cumbersome. Even the most proficient of aetherochemists would be baffled by the unsolved mystery of your impossibly deep pockets."
"Skybuilders' Brazier",28760,"Not only can this be used for the cooking of various dishes, it also works wonders in the prevention of frostbite, as many residents of the Brume will attest."
"Skybuilders' Overalls",28761,"Designed to be worn on top of other layers of clothing to protect them from dust and dirt and provide additional protection against the cold. Since Ishgardians tend to wear several layers of clothing to begin with, these overalls are cut much larger than those worn in warmer climes."
"Skybuilders' Waterproof Sheet",28762,"Serves to keep out not only water, but wind as well, though the cold inevitably finds a way through eventually."
"Skybuilders' Alchemic",28763,"One of many concoctions that serves little purpose on its own, but can be mixed with others for a variety of effects upon consumption, the large majority being some sort of agonizing death."
"Skybuilders' Stew",28764,"One unfortunate rail was left to stew in its own juices after finding its way into the pot. Literally."
"Skybuilders' Yew Log",28765,"The distinct lack of trees is one of many problems the first people to settle in Ishgard chose to ignore, making this otherwise commonplace material─sourced from the East Shroud─extremely valuable."
"Skybuilders' Iron Ore",28766,"While this may look much like any other iron ore found in middle La Noscea, there are subtle differences that only an expert in the field will recognize. The name, for one, is considerably longer."
"Skybuilders' Fine Sand",28767,"This sand gathered in central Thanalan is not only fine, but extremely well behaved, choosing to stay in one closely knit lump while jostling alongside the rest of your possessions."
"Skybuilders' Hemp",28768,"Though this hardy plant can grow almost anywhere, the snow-blasted precipices of Ishgard have so far proven too steep a challenge for it to overcome. This particular specimen was harvested in lower La Noscea, an environment far more conducive to plant life─or any sort of life, for that matter."
"Skybuilders' Ash Log",28769,"Ash! A-Ah! Savior of the Firmament!♪"
"Skybuilders' Rock Salt",28770,"Although upper La Noscea seems rather a distant location from which to source something as simple as salt, the Ishgardians are nothing if not particular in their tastes."
"Skybuilders' Electrum Ore",28771,"The electrum ore found in upper La Noscea is believed to be far better suited to the skybuilders' needs than any other variety. Were anyone to ask them why, they would, in most cases be met with a response along the line of, “Because it just is.”"
"Skybuilders' Iron Sand",28772,"The tradition of measuring powdered substances in units of “pinches” has been the cause of many arguments, largely due to differences in finger size between the various races. Folk in eastern Thanalan, where this sample was gathered, have been known to ask Lalafells to measure when selling, and Roegadyn when buying, for obvious reasons."
"Skybuilders' Flax",28773,"It is a well known fact among botanists that the flax in the South Shroud is superior to every other kind, for reasons far too complicated and boring for anyone else to care about."
"Skybuilders' Spring Water",28774,"Having only traveled the relatively short distance from the Coerthas central highlands to Ishgard, this spring water is still remarkably fresh, though the icy chill threatens to freeze it inside the bottle."
"Skybuilders' Camphorwood Log",28775,"Few members of the mortal races are equipped to make the perilous journey to the Churning Mists, and those who do normally hope to have more than a log or two to show for their troubles."
"Skybuilders' Straw",28776,"Why the skybuilders would specify that their straw be brought from the Dravanian forelands is anyone's guess. Perhaps the smell helps their chocobos sleep more peacefully?"
"Skybuilders' Hardsilver Ore",28777,"The time spent mining this ore in the Dravanian hinterlands would perhaps have seemed less arduous if you had the faintest idea how the skybuilders plan to use it."
"Skybuilders' Mythrite Sand",28778,"You have a sneaking suspicion that you may have lost some of the sand during the return journey from the Sea of Clouds, though the amount you have in your possession should still suffice."
"Skybuilders' Tea Leaves",28779,"The thought of happy skybuilders drinking delicious tea was the only motivation you needed as you risked life and limb gathering these leaves in the Sea of Clouds."
"Skybuilders' Dravanian Spring Water",28780,"There are easier places to collect spring water than the Dravanian forelands, though it seems your personal safety is not especially high on the skybuilders' list of concerns."
"Skybuilders' Urunday Log",28781,"Compared to most places in Gyr Abania, the Peaks has more than its fair share of trees, so who would object to you taking a few logs? Bloodthirsty Qiqirn and rampaging ruud suuds, that's who. Or perhaps they just see you as an easy meal?"
"Skybuilders' Nightsteel Ore",28782,"The Ruby Sea is not especially well known as a prime location for mining, though those who are nautically minded can uncover all sorts of rare and unique treasures. Whether the skybuilders choose to turn this into fine jewelry or something more mundane, like a tea strainer, remains to be seen."
"Skybuilders' Adder",28783,"Venomous snakes are something of a rarity in Ishgard, so the skybuilders have ordered that some be delivered from the Azim Steppe to help improve morale. Workers displaying a lack of enthusiasm will be given some time in “the pit” to rediscover their commitment to the cause."
"Skybuilders' Molybdenum Ore",28784,"While the Lochs are better known as a source of salt, the rich veins of ore are drawing in miners from far and wide."
"Skybuilders' Horsetail",28785,"Yanxia is rich in both flora and fauna, and horsetail forms a major part of the diet of many grazing creatures."
"Skybuilders' Ala Mhigan Rock Salt",28786,"When an Ishgardian culinarian stated that her latest dish needed a pinch of salt, the skybuilders sought out the very best, though perhaps more than a single pinch would be required to make the lengthy journey to the Lochs worthwhile."
"Skybuilders' Ruby Sea Water",28787,"While water from the Ruby Sea may not sound particularly appealing, this was actually brought from a small freshwater spring on one of the surrounding islands. Drinking this is unlikely to result in life-threatening dehydration."
"Skybuilders' Durium Sand",28788,"A pinch of anything tends not to be an awful lot, though this particular sand from the Azim Steppe is apparently worth more than its weight in gold."
"Skybuilders' Vine",28789,"Quite why a particular type of vine that can only be found in the Azim Steppe is necessary to the skybuilders' plans has yet to be explained. Perhaps they are planning to surprise you with a work of surpassing genius? Or perhaps not."
"Skybuilders' White Ash Log",28790,"Obviously, none of the skybuilders has even heard of the Rak'tika Greatwood, though the specific qualities they seek in their timber can most easily be found in the white ash trees that grow there."
"Skybuilders' Reef Rock",28791,"If a porous rock from the bottom of the ocean is required in the rebuilding of Ishgard, then so be it. Your job is to mine, not question the reasoning behind such dubious demands."
"Skybuilders' Truegold Ore",28792,"Why submit a boring chunk of gold ore when you can bring one all the way from Il Mheg instead?"
"Skybuilders' Cotton Boll",28793,"This cotton must be very special indeed for you to bring it all the way from Lakeland in the First. You can only hope that the skybuilders appreciate you going the extra malm. And traveling to another world."
"Skybuilders' Dawn Lizard",28794,"One day, this poor lizard is chasing other, smaller scurrying creatures across the desert plains of Amh Araeng, and the next, it is being transported to another world and dragged lashing and kicking to Ishgard. The chances of the cold-blooded scalekin being content in its frozen new surroundings are slim at best, and you can only hope that the skybuilders are grateful to you for supplying a miserable and motionless lizard."
"Skybuilders' Wheat",28795,"Were the other contributors to hear that you traveled to Amh Araeng in the First simply to procure wheat, they would think you are just trying to show off."
"Skybuilders' Truegold Sand",28796,"The isle of Kholusia is known by the inhabitants of Norvrandt to have the very finest of gold sand. Whether this is up to the impossibly high standards of the skybuilders will only become apparent when it is submitted for inspection."
"Skybuilders' Highland Spring Water",28797,"Any water gathered from Il Mheg is likely to have been enchanted by either the pixies or the Fuath, though that is a problem for the skybuilders, not you, to worry about."
"Skybuilders' Resin",28798,"Thankfully, the resin appears to have suffered no ill effects during your return from the Rak'tika Greatwood, meaning that it is still a gelatinous blob with seemingly no practical application whatsoever."

"Rhotano Wahoo",29728,"Though it seems harmless enough at first glance, this fish has been rendered all but inedible by its highly poisonous diet. The taste is said to be exquisite by those brave enough to try it, however.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]"
"Rhotano Sardine",29729,"Usually seen traveling in large schools, these rather plain fish possess the group mentality of a flock of sheep─that is, to follow whoever is in front and, lacking that, just keep moving forward until something with big teeth appears. Then all hells break loose.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]"
"Ogre Eel",29733,"Even when it finds itself dangling from an angler's line, its only thought is to consume as much flesh as possible, which causes many a fisher to cast it back into the sea in sheer panic.

[Suitable for printing on large canvases.]"
"Oschon's Stone",29738,"Seemingly living up to its namesake, this heavy and largely immobile wavekin spends most of its life on the ocean floor. It feeds by opening its mouth and waiting for curious prey to swim inside.

[Suitable for printing on large canvases.]"
"Sabaton",29746,"Strangely for a mollusk, its body is covered in hard scales in addition to the more common shell. Many predators will steer clear of them simply because they are a bother to eat.

"Shooting Star",29747,"One's chances of seeing an actual shooting star are greater than that of being able to observe one of these rare wavekin in its natural habitat.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]"
"Hammerclaw",29748,"While most wavekin object quite strongly to being caught on a hook, these crustaceans make life especially difficult for anglers in retaliation. If they are not pinching fingers, they are flailing wildly with their heavy claws, both of which most fishers should and do go to great lengths to avoid.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]"
"Heavenskey",29749,"Due to being highly poisonous, it is believed to send those who eat of its flesh to the heavens. Compared to the seven hells, this may prove a more desirable destination.

"Casket Oyster",29753,"While there are several theories surrounding the origin of its name, the general consensus is that it is as hard to open as a casket that has been nailed shut. However, it is nothing a brief spell in a pot of boiling water cannot solve.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]"
"Great Grandmarlin",29758,"More often than not, this hulking yet deceptively quick wavekin escapes the angler's hook, usually by severing the line with its bladelike bill.

[Suitable for printing on large canvases.]"
"Shipwreck's Sail",29759,"This wavekin is so broad and flat that it has been compared to the sail of a ship left to float on the tide. In actuality, it is waiting for seabirds to pick the parasites from its flanks.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]"
"Roguesaurus",29765,"Named after the river rather than the traditional Lominsan profession. Those unfortunate enough to encounter one will testify that to describe it as roguish would be an understatement, and that “murderous,” “man-eating,” and “malevolent” would all be more applicable adjectives.

[Suitable for printing on extra large canvases.]"
"Merman's Mane",29766,"Though the existence of mermen is much debated, if any were to exist, they would no doubt object to the comparisons drawn between their long locks and the tentacles of this grotesque cephalopod.

"Mopbeard",29773,"Lifting it above the waterline causes it to transform from an elegant oceanic beauty to something resembling...well, a mop.

"Slipsnail",29774,"While it may seem harmless enough, it has a nasty surprise in store for unwitting predators.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]"
"Aronnax",29775,"Its remarkable speed is matched only by its unfathomable clumsiness, the combination of which often leads it straight into the waiting nets of fishers.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]"
"Coccosteus",29776,"Revered by the Sahagin and reviled by practically everyone else. Its proclivity for biting fingers means that most who catch one end up wishing they hadn't.

[Suitable for printing on large canvases.]"
"Bartholomew the Chopper",29777,"Suspected by some to be the reincarnation of an unhinged murderer, although it is also known to have a more amiable side. Well, about as amiable as one can expect from a wavekin that revels in killing.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]"
"Prowler",29778,"While the word “prowl” may suggest the slow, deliberate movement of one tracking its prey, this particular wavekin is simply slow by nature, mainly as a result of sheer indolence.

[Suitable for printing on small canvases.]"
"Charlatan Survivor",29779,"At first glance, the charlatan survivor may appear to be a well-armored crustacean, but the outer shell is merely a purloined disguise concealing a much smaller creature beneath. Luckily, predatory wavekin are quite easily deceived and often choose to leave it alone in order to pursue less chitinous prey.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]"
"Prodigal Son",29780,"Rather than follow the standard migratory patterns of his brethren, this wandering wavekin swims to the beat of his own drum, and comes and goes as he pleases.

"Gugrusaurus",29781,"Spends most of its life attempting to slaughter anything and everything that it catches sight of. Considering the ample opportunities to practice such skills, it has become rather good at it.

"The Fallen One",29783,"Believed by some to have descended from the heavens, and judging by the way it nervously flits about the ocean, it wishes it could return to whence it came. Few wavekin look less comfortable in their habitat than this unfortunate creature.

[Suitable for printing on medium canvases.]"
"Spectral Megalodon",29784,"Due to the fact that most of its prey are petrified upon catching sight of this ominously glowing predator, it has rather an easy time finding a steady supply of food.

"Sothis",29788,"It is unclear how this species of turtle came to have a shell covered in glittering crystal, though it does give oceanic hunters pause for thought before they attempt to bite down on it. This could be considered a form of unnatural protection.

"Elasmosaurus",29791,"In the harsh, unforgiving open sea, few creatures have proven a more valuable ally to mankind than the elasmosaurus. Though they are most often known to tow ships and carry out courageous acts of self-sacrifice, these gentle giants can also be lethally dangerous when angered.

"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Plywood",29792,"While this could be combined with a few bricks to create a makeshift bench, that may fall somewhat short of the skybuilders' rather more lofty aspirations."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Alloy",29793,"Even in its current state, it would make a functional, if not especially elegant, murder weapon."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Steel Plate",29794,"To some, it may seem a shame to ruin such a beautifully square piece of metal by battering it with a hammer."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Ingot",29795,"These would make a suitable substitute for house bricks were it not for their natural propensity to conduct cold, which is less than ideal in the freezing climes of Ishgard."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Leather",29796,"Considered to be particularly valuable, especially by the creature to which it originally belonged."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Rope",29797,"Perfectly suited to pulling heavy objects. Less well suited to pushing them."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Ink",29798,"While some may question the skybuilders' need for a specific type of ink, it is believed that this particular variety is more resistant to the cold. After all, frozen ink does not lend itself well to fine penmanship, or any sort of penmanship, for that matter."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Hemp Milk",29799,"While the layman may question exactly how one goes about milking a plant, the process is much the same as milking anything else: you give it a damned good squeeze and hope for the best."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Crate",29800,"Despite much of the work in the Firmament involving taking supplies out of boxes, the need occasionally arises to put them into boxes instead. Suggestions that the skybuilders simply reuse the boxes they already have were immediately shot down, presumably by someone who stands to profit from the production of new containers."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Nails",29801,"Never was the description “tough as nails” more apt, because they are, in fact, nails."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Rivets",29802,"Despite their name, discussions on these commonplace metal studs tend to be anything but riveting."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Rings",29803,"Attempting to impress a potential spouse by presenting one of these mass-produced metallic circles will generally end in failure, and perhaps even a slap in the face for good measure."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Leather Straps",29804,"Some may wonder whether this leather was in fact more useful before it was cut into long strips. It could have been used to make a nice coat, for example."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Cloth",29805,"As the popular Coerthan adage attests, “One can never have too much cloth.”"
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Plant Oil",29806,"Not only is it used by chefs, but also masseuses. Unfortunately, there is not much call for such work in Ishgard, as the general consensus is that clothes are best kept on at all times unless absolutely necessary."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Bread",29807,"While it is true that man cannot live on bread alone, a little bit here and there certainly does not go amiss."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Grindstone",29808,"Clearly, the expression “nose to the grindstone” was not meant to be taken literally, though some have chosen to find this out the hard way."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Hammer",29809,"Tenderizing pork with this craftsman's tool does not, as one might be forgiven for thinking given the name, turn it into ham."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Still",29810,"This bizarre contraption is coveted by alchemists and culinarians alike. When asked for what purpose, the response is generally along the lines of, “Mumble, mumble, steam, mumble, mumble.”"
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Embroidery Frame",29811,"A firm favorite among ladies of leisure, oft held mid-stitch as they gaze wistfully from the window of their opulent bedchamber, high in their metaphorical─and in some cases, actual─ivory tower."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Rug",29812,"Some things are best swept under one of these."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Broom",29813,"Those expecting this perfectly ordinary broom to start speaking backwards or sweeping floors of its own accord will be disappointed to find it does neither, unless a passing witch is in the mood for a couple of incantations."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Dye",29814,"Those thinking about using this colorful dye for their own purposes should put such thoughts aside, as it is strictly for skybuilder use only. After all, one can hardly expect them to go about their work deprived of the ability to turn something purple at a moment's notice."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Tea",29815,"Skybuilders have garnered a reputation for punctuating their work with frequent tea breaks. The number of cups drunk by a laborer over the course of a single day can easily reach double digits."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Stepladder",29816,"Unlike most other items requested by the skybuilders, this one actually seems to serve some practical purpose. It can even be carried on one shoulder, allowing the bearer to pivot quickly, which leads to all sorts of hilarity as their colleagues attempt, often in vain, to avoid having their skull cracked."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Crosscut Saw",29817,"The sound it makes as it cleaves through timber is akin to that of a person snoring. One particular linguist even went so far as to investigate a possible connection between the words “sawing” and “snoring,” and to no one's surprise but her own, discovered that nothing of the sort exists."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Mesail",29818,"Perfect for protecting one's face from the accusing glares of innocent bystanders during daylight robberies and so forth, although the skybuilders have a far more pedestrian use in mind."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Stone",29819,"A strong contender for the heaviest item requested by the skybuilders. How the volunteers are expected to transport these without an exceedingly sturdy cart is anyone's guess."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Longboots",29820,"As the name implies, these boots are what some might consider long, although longer still are the grade 2 skybuilders' longlongboots."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Gloves",29821,"Keepers of hounds with the tendency to bite the hand that feeds will be delighted to receive a pair of these fine gloves. The smooth lining allows the wearer to slip out easily, leaving said dog with a mouthful of tough leather, which it will soon learn makes a poor substitute for proper food."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Soap",29822,"When combined with an empty stocking, can be used as a makeshift weapon. In Ishgard, this appears to be the most common use, since many residents have discovered that the need to wash is largely mitigated by the wearing of multiple layers of thick clothing, which does little to prevent bodily odor, but does cause it to take longer to seep through and reach the nostrils of those in the immediate vicinity."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' All-purpose Infusion",29823,"There may be uncertainty surrounding its exact effects, although one thing is clear: it definitely tastes as if it does one good. That is to say, revolting."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Bed",29824,"As it stands only a few ilms off of the floor, any things that go bump in the night will have trouble squeezing under this particular bed."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Oven",29825,"Complete with raging fire and billowing smoke, which, while impressive, does make it rather troublesome to transport."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Lamppost",29826,"Those with high ceilings in their chambers may wish to employ this as a rather extravagant bedside reading light."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Brazier",29827,"Any meat fried on this outdoor brazier produces smoke with the uncanny ability to find its way into the eyes of those foolish enough to wander too near."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Overalls",29828,"Designed to be worn on top of other, nicer clothes. Ideal for those who like to muck out their chocobo stables immediately before going for afternoon tea with an overbearing but wealthy aunt."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Gazebo",29829,"Purpose-built for picnics in the great outdoors, protecting those beneath from any untimely precipitation. Unfortunately, the snow in most parts of Coerthas tends to fall in a rather sideways fashion, thus rendering this gazebo entirely pointless."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Alchemic",29830,"The joy gained from sampling its fragrance─reminiscent of summer meadows─normally only lasts until the caustic vapors burn the skin from the inside of one's nostrils."
"Grade 2 Skybuilders' Stew",29831,"The term “potluck” applies perfectly to this particular dish, as it is traditionally assembled from whatever the chef can dig up from an often poorly lit pantry. The fact that rats tend to squeak and wriggle a fair bit when picked up is probably all that prevents them from being added to the mix. The dead ones, on the other hand..."
"Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Wardrobe",29832,"If, for any reason, one has the need to hide inside, such as the unexpected return of one of the residents and so on, the air holes provided should prevent untimely suffocation. Not that there is such a thing as “timely suffocation.”"
"Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Chandelier",29833,"Most of the diamonds are actually imitations, but thankfully, chandeliers are usually positioned high enough that no one will notice."
"Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Fireplace",29834,"The ideal place to put a fire, hence the clever name. Well, the last part, that is."
"Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Bathtub",29835,"In mankind's ongoing quest to keep “water” and “not water” ever separate, few inventions have done more to further the cause than the humble bathtub."
"Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Overcoat",29836,"If dapperness could be captured, refined, and made into a wearable material, that is what this fine garment would be made from. Until then, cloth and leather will have to suffice."
"Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Wallpaper",29837,"Generally less messy than covering walls with paint, although its natural tendency to tear and wrinkle with the slightest provocation is enough to make a saint swear."
"Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Remedies",29838,"It is assumed that each of these glass phials contains something useful, as none of them are labeled. Identification by taste is probably best left to a professional or someone who is not opposed to being lightly poisoned."
"Grade 2 Artisanal Skybuilders' Quiche",29839,"In cases such as these, “artisanal” actually means “so complex that even the chef doesn't remember what went into it,” hence the impossibility of replicating the recipe."
"Approved Grade 2 Skybuilders' Switch",29840,"A sharp rap across the back of the thigh in the cold, crisp Ishgardian morning air with one of these light and flexible branches is a surefire way to blow away the proverbial cobwebs of any workers caught yawning.

"Approved Grade 2 Skybuilders' Maple Log",29844,"The sap slowly leaking from the logs tends to attract ants, which even the skybuilders have yet to find a use for.

"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Plywood",31184,"Some pieces of plywood have a thin veneer covering the surface to give the impression of being made from actual wood. This specimen, however, harbors no such pretensions and is every bit as cheap as it looks."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Alloy",31185,"The favored alloy of the hoi polloi."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Steel Plate",31186,"Despite the name, this is not a robust, metallic piece of tableware. The main reason it is unsuited to such a purpose is that there is nothing to stop peas from rolling off the edge."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Ingot",31187,"Though ingots are fairly ubiquitous in most forms of metalworking, far less commonly seen is a variation known as an outgot, which is exactly the same but upside down."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Leather",31188,"When choosing the name, the skybuilders were far more concerned with assigning a grade than specifying the animal from which the leather originally came. It does smell a bit like goat, if that is anything to go by."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Rope",31189,"This is what string wants to be when it grows up."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Ink",31190,"“If you took away my paper, I would write on my heart. If you took away my ink, I would write on the wind.
...It wouldn't be an ideal way to work.”

"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Hemp Milk",31191,"Being made from plant extracts, this refreshing beverage stretches the definition of what is normally considered to be milk. Then again, if seahorses and starfish are anything to go by, names can often be misleading."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Crate",31192,"With all the crates scattered around the Firmament, the skybuilders have need of a means of storing them. It is for this exact purpose that this particular container was designed. Calls for it to be renamed the “crate crate” have been largely ignored."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Nails",31193,"Even a simple table leg can be transformed into a deadly bludgeon by hammering a few of these nails into the end. Perfect for adventurers on a tight budget."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Rivets",31194,"Some may argue that rivets are nothing more than nails without the pointy bit."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Rings",31195,"These metal rings can apparently be joined and unjoined at will, though the only people capable of such a feat are sleight of hand artists. The skybuilders, however, are reluctant to employ such unscrupulous characters for fear of them fleecing the other workers, leaving these rings in a decidedly unjoined state."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Leather Straps",31196,"When times are hard, many of the poor resort to eating leather to survive. Cutting said material into strips beforehand makes it somewhat easier to digest, or at the very least, easier to chew."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Cloth",31197,"In most regions, people dress according to their personal preferences. In Ishgard, people dress according to their need to not freeze to death. Cloth such as this is as essential to survival as basic sustenance, if not more, as the cold will kill you faster than an empty stomach."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Plant Oil",31198,"The people of Ishgard have endless uses for plant oil, though the local climate is less than ideal for the cultivation of said plants, or anything to cook using said oil, for that matter."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Sesame Cookie",31199,"In order to be classed as grade 3, each cookie must contain a certain number of sesame seeds. Needless to say, counting them is one of the most tedious tasks undertaken by the skybuilders, though it works remarkably well as a cure for insomnia."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Grinding Wheel",31200,"Primarily used for filing down the various materials used in goldsmithing, as well as providing an effective─though not especially portable─means of keeping fingernails short."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Pickaxe",31201,"Useful not only for clearing rocks and debris, but also for dispatching any creatures that may emerge. In the case of Copperbell Mines, however, such creatures are often armed with pickaxes of their own."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Cookpot",31202,"Can also be used as a makeshift bathtub by Lalafells, provided they refrain from sloshing water everywhere by making the pot sway back and forth."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Embroidery Frame",31203,"Though there is little discernible difference between the grade 2 and grade 3 embroidery frames, the name alone strongly implies that this version is infinitely superior. "
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Leather Sack",31204,"If one of the workers in the Firmament is given one of these sacks, it should be taken as meaning “pack up your things and leave.” Ishgard maintains the tradition of literally giving someone the sack when their employment has been terminated."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Broom",31205,"Those who believe the tales of witches flying around on broomsticks have obviously never tried flying one for themselves. They take to the air about as well as a heavily armored Temple Knight takes to water, which is to say, not very."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Holy Water",31206,"Believed to cure zombification. Grade 3 is claimed to grant a full recovery, whereas grade 2 only delays the onset of the symptoms, and grade 1 merely replaces the need to feast on the flesh of the living with a craving for copious amounts of bacon. "
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Tea",31207,"A grade 3 cup is stirred using a figure of eight motion, rather than the traditional circular movement used for the grade 2 variety. Claims that this has any discernible effect on the flavor are largely regarded as nonsense, however."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Stepladder",31208,"Perhaps when man and dragon have formed a stronger bond of trust, the skybuilders may take to the air on dragonback to perform all manner of tasks at higher altitudes. Until that day, mankind will just have to rely on good, old-fashioned stepladders."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Crosscut Saw",31209,"Extremely effective at producing sawdust. Also cuts wood."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Mesail",31210,"This would be perfect for protecting one's eyes from flying sparks while performing metalwork─the task it was primarily designed for─were it not for the large eyeholes."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Stone",31211,"Despite its abundance in Coerthas, the skybuilders are quick to remind others that “stone like this doesn't grow on trees.” Factually accurate, yes. Logically sound, not so much."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Longboots",31212,"In other parts of Hydaelyn, people would consider wearing two pairs of socks ample protection against the cold. In Coerthas, it is common to wear two pairs of boots, one over the other, as well as maybe a couple more pairs of socks for good measure."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Gloves",31213,"For those wondering what the distinction between the grade 2 and grade 3 varieties might be, they need only smell the glove."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Soap",31214,"When strategically placed on the floor, a wet bar of soap can be used to form a makeshift death trap for offing heiresses and the like."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' All-purpose Infusion",31215,"Whereas many concoctions are said to prevent various ailments, this one supposedly prevents all manner of accidents. In addition to drinking the recommended daily dose, one must avoid physical exertion, unnecessary excursions, and anything even remotely resembling danger to enjoy the effects of the infusion to their fullest. "
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Bed",31216,"Bed, bedder, bedst.
Never let it rest.
Till your bed is bedder, and your bedder bedst."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Oven",31217,"Large enough to fit a whole witch inside."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Lamppost",31218,"Keep this lamppost away from dogs, or alternatively, keep dogs away from this lamppost. Whichever is more feasible."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Brazier",31219,"This traditional cooking apparatus offers Ishgardians the opportunity to enjoy two of their favorite pastimes: fried meat and not freezing to death."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Overalls",31220,"Overall the best thing to wear over all of one's clothes."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Awning",31221,"Protects one's eyes from the glaring sunlight, should any of it manage to find its way through the layers of dense cloud that hang almost perpetually over Ishgard."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Growth Formula",31222,"The original creator claims it works on almost anything, within reason. Stone, for example, stubbornly refuses to grow no matter how much formula is applied."
"Grade 3 Skybuilders' Stew",31223,"The grade 3 stew actually contains ingredients with names other than “dunno” or “not sure, but it was definitely dead when I threw it in.”"
"Grade 3 Artisanal Skybuilders' Goldsmithing Bench",31224,"Not only is the workbench rather lavishly made, it can also be used in the crafting of further lavishly made items."
"Grade 3 Artisanal Skybuilders' Smithing Bench",31225,"Suited to almost any sort of smithing besides wordsmithing, for which a regular desk will suffice."
"Grade 3 Artisanal Skybuilders' Door",31226,"“When one door closes, another one opens? Sounds like you'd have trouble keeping out the draught.”

"Grade 3 Artisanal Skybuilders' Chronometer",31227,"Though the use of such timepieces is still fairly limited in Ishgard, this particular model includes a bell that be set to ring at a specified time, earning it the rather catchy appellation “alarum chronometer.”"
"Grade 3 Artisanal Skybuilders' Leather Chair",31228,"Luckily, only the upholstery is made from leather. If the inner frame were made from the same material, it would have a difficult time supporting the weight of anything heavier than a medium-sized cat."
"Grade 3 Artisanal Skybuilders' Apron",31229,"Basically a large dishcloth with a few straps attached. However, it is these straps that earn the apron the right to be called artisanal, as they will not come undone no matter how hard they are tugged by needy children begging for cookies."
"Grade 3 Artisanal Skybuilders' Tiled Flooring",31230,"The use of materials that are naturally cold to the touch in the chilly land of Coerthas may be considered a design flaw, but it is actually a designer floor."
"Grade 3 Artisanal Skybuilders' Luncheon",31231,"Though an army may march on its stomach, the skybuilders choose a more effective means of forward locomotion: walking with their legs. It is for this reason they require sustenance, and this hearty meal provides exactly that, along with enough grease to kill a sasquatch."
"Approved Grade 3 Skybuilders' Switch",31232,"Makes a satisfying “thwack” sound when swung through the air. On the other hand, attempting to actually hit something will cause it to break immediately, so it is reserved only for scare tactics.

"Approved Grade 3 Skybuilders' Mistletoe",31243,"Used in a variety of medical treatments despite being highly toxic. Failure to adhere to the correct dosage may lead to symptoms far worse than the ailment it was meant to cure."
"Approved Grade 3 Skybuilders' Toad",31244,"One of the skybuilders has been tasked with kissing every toad they receive on the off chance of it being a cursed prince.

"Approved Grade 3 Skybuilders' Diadem Iron Ore",31247,"Though similar substances exist in other regions, the Diadem variety tends to be more highly coveted. This may simply be due to its scarcity rather than any intrinsic properties, as by and large, the more difficult something is to obtain, the more people want it."
"Approved Grade 3 Skybuilders' Alumen",31248,"In recent years, there have been calls to abandon the use of “pinches” as a unit of measurement for powders. However, the fact that an amount equal to a single pinch is rarely enough to cause even the most sensitive of scales to budge leads to difficulties when deciding on a weight-based standard."
"Approved Grade 3 Skybuilders' Spring Water",31249,"The name may indicate that there are very specific criteria to pass muster with the skybuilders, but the taste and smell are the same as almost any other type of water. That is to say: it tastes of nothing and smells of nothing."
"Approved Grade 3 Skybuilders' Diadem Iron Sand",31250,"As is often the case with items found in the Diadem, this iron sand possesses unique properties. It is magnetically attracted not only to metallic objects, but a range of organic materials, such as skin and clothing, which means it is often gathered regardless of one's intentions."
"Approved Grade 3 Skybuilders' Siltstone",31251,"This flaky, lightweight stone is a firm favorite with street performers who demonstrate their strength by smashing through rock with their bare hands."
"Approved Grade 3 Skybuilders' Cedar Log",31252,"Due to cedar being a natural repellent for moths─which can be both extremely large and ferocious in some parts─many adventurers have taken to carrying it about their person. Hefting around an entire log might be going a touch overboard, however.

"Oddly Delicate Silvergrace Ore",31759,"For all its delicacy, this is nevertheless a chunk of ore, and quite capable of leaving a nasty mark when thrown at someone's head."
"Oddly Delicate Scheelite",31760,"While standard scheelite is certainly rare, the oddly delicate variant is scarce to the point of being practically nonexistent."
"Oddly Delicate Raw Celestine",31761,"This chunk of unrefined crystal is not itself especially delicate, but has the potential to produce pieces of remarkable delicacy. Whether this is beneficial in any way whatsoever, however, remains to be seen."
"Oddly Delicate Gazelle Hide",31762,"Rest assured that the gazelle to which this once belonged was slaughtered in the most delicate way possible."
"Oddly Delicate Rhea",31763,"Rhea this oddly delicate is reserved for the production of oddly delicate rhea cloth. It is then, in turn, used to make all sorts of cloth-based items, provided that they are not hindered in any way by being oddly delicate, which rules out practically everything."
"Oddly Delicate Mistletoe",31764,"If one happens to eat one of these poisonous berries, they may find that their stomach also becomes oddly delicate."
"Oddly Delicate Hammerhead Shark",31765,"The “oddly delicate” part refers not to the shark's physical attributes, but to its demeanor. Due to being dead, however, this is something of a moot point."
"Oddly Delicate Feather",31766,"For all the feathers adorning a cloudkin's body, only a rare few could be considered oddly delicate. Those are generally found around the wingpit, the avian equivalent of an armpit, obviously."
"Oddly Delicate Birch Log",31767,"Oddly delicate for a birch log, though still fairly hefty by most people's standards."
"Oddly Delicate Adamantite Ore",31768,"Adamantite, as the name would suggest, is anything but delicate, though this particular sample is perhaps ever-so-slightly less than “practically indestructible.”"
"Oddly Delicate Raw Jade",31769,"Hopefully not so delicate that it will shatter into a thousand pieces at the first attempt to refine it."
"Flintstrike",31770,"The glow it emits when swimming through the ocean depths is reminiscent of sparks flying from a struck flint. Thankfully, it does not present an actual fire hazard, despite what some may think.

Can only be caught when equipped with a skysung fishing rod.

"Pickled Pom",31771,"Closely resembling a moogle's pom-pom, apart from the strange odor. Saying it smells pickled is a rather charitable description.

"Cardamom",31912,"Boasting a unique fragrance, these seeds are the secret spice in myriad recipes."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Plywood",31913,"The skybuilders are known for plying their trade by applying plies to provide supplies of plywood. Now try saying that ten times fast with a mouthful of porridge."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Alloy",31914,"A marvelous mixture of malleable metals melded into magnificently molded...blocks."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Steel Plate",31915,"To be fair is rare, and to be square even rarer, but to be both fair and square is miraculous indeed."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Ingot",31916,"It is believed in certain circles that the word “ingot” is derived from the verb “to inget” meaning “to breathe in and out simultaneously, causing the air to become trapped in the larynx, creating a sound akin to a hiccupping buffalo.”"
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Leather",31917,"The time and effort spent on cutting each hide into perfect circles would have been better spent on...well, anything else. Not to mention the amount of wasted leather now lying in a pile of offcuts. However, one thing can be said of the skybuilders: there is madness in their method."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Rope",31918,"While this may seem like a good choice for a children's skipping rope, it is weighty enough to leave a painful welt on either the temples or ankles of those with a poor sense of timing. Still, some might say that only adds to the fun."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Ink",31919,"The grade 4 variety of ink is said to be especially quick-drying, which helps to prevent smudging. Some claim, however, that the ink dries before it even has time to reach the parchment, which does rather defeat the purpose of the ink in the first place."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Hemp Milk",31920,"“We challenged Ishgardians to taste the difference between hemp milk and a leading dairy-based competitor. Eight in ten participants claimed they tasted exactly the same, while the remainder complained of a stomachache from drinking too much milk.”

"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Crate",31921,"“If you see a crate, try looking inside. There may be a small amount of gil or even potions or medicinal herbs inside.

"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Nails",31922,"In traditional Doman carpentry, the wooden pieces are carefully carved to allow them to snugly interlock and remain steadfast for years to come. In Ishgard, however, the wood is considerably less cooperative, and must have little metal spikes driven through it to stay where it is told. "
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Rivets",31923,"Although being covered in rivets tends to make basically anything look a lot more sturdy, the act of driving them in to begin with probably compromises the object's structural integrity to some degree. It certainly has that effect on a person's skull."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Rings",31924,"Those who cannot afford proper metal gauntlets can try threading these metallic rings onto their fingers to produce a similar effect. Just be sure to keep your fists clenched to stop them falling off."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Leather Straps",31925,"The artisans responsible for the creation of such wares are often described as “strapping,” but usually in a literal rather than figurative sense."

"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Plant Oil",31927,"Best burned at midnight."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Sesame Cookie",31928,"Ishgardian parents often tell their children that the sesame seeds are in fact dead flies that were trapped in the batter prior to baking. Not only does this have the effect of keeping the young ones' hands out of the cookie jar, it also leads them to a few raised eyebrows in regard to their parents' choice of confectionery. "
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Spinning Wheel",31929,"One of the few wheels that can turn all day and not move an ilm."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Hatchet",31930,"A common choice of weapon in civilian uprisings, though it leaves much to be desired in the “long and pointy” stakes, unlike the ever-popular pitchfork."

"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Embroidery Frame",31932,"A frame so intricately detailed and immaculately crafted that it threatens to upstage the embroidery it is designed to keep in place."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Leather Sack",31933,"The leather of this sack once held the flesh, bones, and organs of a large beast, but has now been granted the opportunity to store a much wider and more interesting range of objects. Unless, that is, it is purchased by a butcher, in which case the contents may end up being largely the same as its previous incarnation."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Broom",31934,"Combatants who claim they will “sweep the floor” with their opponent should try one of these brooms instead. Twice the cleanliness with none of the violence."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Holy Water",31935,"“Why's this called holy water? I don't see any holes in it.”
─A confused and somewhat illiterate skybuilder"
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Tea",31936,"Contains so much sugar that some claim the smell alone is enough to make one's teeth fall out."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Stepladder",31937,"“Takes just as many steps to climb up as it does to climb down” is the slogan used by the skybuilders when pitching their stepladders to potential customers, though any sales made tend to be in spite of said slogan rather than because of it."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Crosscut Saw",31938,"Strangely enough, it is not particularly well suited to cutting crosses."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Mesail",31939,"As any smith will attest, the heat of the forge can be overwhelming. Were it not for the conveniently placed air holes, their heads would be baked inside their mesails like cow-brain pies (an Ishgardian delicacy)."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Stone",31940,"Since ancient times, man has sought to move exceedingly large blocks of stone from one location to another. In the past, methods such as conveying the material atop a series of rolling logs or ferrying it on extremely buoyant rafts were employed, whereas all it requires these days is one plucky volunteer with bottomless pockets."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Longboots",31941,"It is said that over the years, the design for longboots grew longer and longer, until the two boots eventually met in the middle and lost the part covering the foot entirely─perhaps to save on materials─and became what are now known as trousers."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Gloves",31942,"Long have gloves waged war in the marketplace against mittens, their archrivals, though the wearer's ability to move each finger individually has proved to be a deciding factor in securing their popularity."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Soap",31943,"In a stroke of sheer genius, the skybuilders have succeeded in inventing a variety of soap that floats on water, much to the delight of the people of Ishgard─those who actually wash, that is."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' All-purpose Infusion",31944,"A remarkable concoction that is able to treat any ailment the salesperson is able to imagine. The lack of complaints following purchase indicates that the customer is either entirely satisfied with the effects, or dead from poisoning."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Bed",31945,"The mattress is made from a spongelike material to help absorb any...nocturnal spillages."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Oven",31946,"Sometimes, the phrase “she's got a bun in the oven” is meant to be taken literally. In fact, this common saying has led to all sorts of hilarious misunderstandings, particularly in cases where the woman in question likes to bake her own bread."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Lamppost",31947,"Spare a thought for the poor souls whose job it is to light each of the lanterns that line the streets of the Firmament every evening. Perhaps one day, someone will be so kind as to invent a system whereby they may be lit and extinguished remotely. Unfortunately, many of Ishgard's civic engineers are preoccupied with far more frivolous pursuits, such as imbuing tools with mystic energy using oddly specific materials."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Brazier",31948,"One must take great care not to confuse this with the similarly named ladies' undergarment."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Overalls",31949,"While it is common for mud, paint, and other stains to collect on overalls, some of the skybuilders have taken to deliberately dirtying their clothing to fool others into thinking they have been hard at work. Since a skybuilder's pay is largely based on their performance, however, those who attempt such tricks are normally left with naught but soiled overalls and empty pockets."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Awning",31950,"Is there anything more pleasant than yawning in the morning as day is dawning, beneath an awning?"
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Growth Formula",31951,"There are rumors that claim the remarkable height of Elezen is due to doses of growth formula being slipped into their morning porridge from a young age. Attempts to reproduce such an effect on the Lalafells who willingly volunteered as test subjects have yet to yield results, other than an unnatural aversion to porridge."
"Grade 4 Skybuilders' Stew",31952,"Many culinarians believe the secret to a good stew is to never allow the pot to become empty by constantly topping it up with fresh ingredients. This may in fact be an elaborate ploy to avoid ever having to wash the pot, not to mention that some parts of the stew may have been in the mix for several years without being served. Diners are advised to “eat around” anything that seems a bit suspicious."
"Grade 4 Artisanal Skybuilders' Icebox",31953,"Though such a device would seem to have little use in Ishgard, where foodstuffs may be kept chilled simply by placing them outside, the icebox does offer protection from rats and crows. But then again, so would any other type of box."
"Grade 4 Artisanal Skybuilders' Chocobo Weathervane",31954,"If it starts spinning wildly, it means the wind is blowing in all of the directions at once."
"Grade 4 Artisanal Skybuilders' Company Chest",31955,"This communal deposit relies on the honesty of not only every member of the company─to give what they can and take only what they need─but every other person who passes through the Firmament, as it is left completely unlocked at all times. The members of said companies are often surprised to find the chest completely empty upon opening it, while opportunistic thieves enjoy their easy pickings."
"Grade 4 Artisanal Skybuilders' Astroscope",31956,"Such devices are often found pointing in the direction of the open-air baths, which is in keeping with the letter─rather than the spirit─of its intended purpose, that being “the observation of heavenly bodies.”"
"Grade 4 Artisanal Skybuilders' Tool Belt",31957,"While it may not seem especially voluminous, this belt is capable of holding up to thirty-five primary tools and the same number of secondary tools. One might have trouble actually moving with an entire shed's worth of heavy equipment hanging from one's waist, however."
"Grade 4 Artisanal Skybuilders' Vest",31958,"Far more luxurious than most other garments of its kind, with a price to match. Most would think twice before investing in this vest."
"Grade 4 Artisanal Skybuilders' Tincture",31959,"“Should you find any mysterious phials of liquid, be sure to take them with you. After all, the clinking of glass from all the potions, ethers, and elixirs an adventurer is known for carrying about their person is one of the easiest ways for a potential client to distinguish them from a marauding barbarian.”

"Grade 4 Artisanal Skybuilders' Sorbet",31960,"Although a lot of care and effort went into the preparation of this sweet treat, a similar effect could easily be achieved by leaving a glass of fruit juice outside in the cold Ishgardian air for half a bell or so."
"Approved Grade 4 Skybuilders' Switch",31961,"As many Ishgardian schoolchildren will attest, telling one's detractors “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words shall never harm me” is an open invitation to be assaulted with said objects.

"Approved Grade 4 Skybuilders' Sesame",31966,"The sesame plant is robust enough to grow in even the most inhospitable environments, including those in which the botanists tasked with gathering said plant are incapable of surviving. As valuable as sesame is, most would agree it is not worth risking life and limb for, not that the skybuilders seem particularly bothered by this when making their requests...

"Approved Grade 4 Skybuilders' Cotton Boll",31967,"A freshly picked cotton boll with the stem still attached is the perfect implement for cleaning one's ears, though it is likely that the skybuilders will notice if that same cotton boll is submitted to them after being used. They tend to object to that sort of thing.

"Approved Grade 4 Skybuilders' Ore",31968,"Only a true skybuilder could look at a nondescript lump of grey, slightly metallic rock and say, “Yes, this is definitely grade 4 skybuilders' ore,” though it could be argued that this is because they are the ones who named it to begin with.

"Approved Grade 4 Skybuilders' Rock Salt",31969,"“But Mother, can we not break the salt rock into smaller chunks to save us all from having to lick the same piece? It seems awfully unhygienic.”
